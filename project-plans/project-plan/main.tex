\section{Project Description}

In this project we will implement a navigation controller for the control of two or more drones individually. Initially, the goal is to be able to move two drones to certain points while avoiding collisions. Subsequently, a more advanced path planning task (that has yet to be decided) will be implemented.

\section{Working Method}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weekly meetings with our supervisor to monitor weekly progress and discuss issues
    \item Weekly meetings with all group members to discuss questions and assign tasks
    \item Discussions and sharing important information in a facebook group
    \item Code sharing through a github repository
    \item Work on assigned tasks individually or in part groups
    \item Work load per week per person: 20 hours
\end{itemize}
\section{Roles and Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Project Leader: Joakim
\item Joakim will have meetings with Jonas after the project reviews
\item Division of tasks on weekly basis to individuals and part groups
\end{itemize}

\section{Time Plan}
\subsection{First week}
\textbf{Milestone: Having a preliminary project plan and two assembled Crazy Flies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write down a project plan
    \item Read up on CrazyFlie (hardware etc.), tutorials etc.
    \item Assemble two CrazyFlies
    \item Learn about ROS (attending the seminar)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Second week}
\textbf{Milestone: Software and hardware setup and configuration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Go through ROS-tutorials
    \item Assemble remaining hardware
    \item Connect to CrazyFlie
    \item Connect to anchors
    \item Set up github-repository
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Third week}
\textbf{Milestone: Get attitude and positioning estimation working}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Get the anchors positioned (find best positions)
    \item Implement position/attitude estimation software
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fourth week}
\textbf{Milestone: Get one drone to hover}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing abstracted ROS code to moving up the drone (implementing hovering/landing service)
    \item Tune bitcraze controller
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Fifth week}
\textbf{Milestone: Simple trajectory following for one drone}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Get drone to go from point A to point B
    \item Get drone to follow a simple predefined trajectory, such as a circle
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sixth week}
\textbf{Milestone: Control two agents and implement collision avoidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce a second agent and get the communication working with both
    \item Set up algorithms for drones to avoid hitting each other
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Seventh week}
\textbf{Milestone: Implement a multiagent pathplanning task}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing a more advanced path planning task with at least two drones (still to be determined)
    \item for example: position swapping, following an anchor, flying in a swarm without colliding
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Eigth week}
\textbf{Milestone: Finishing up the project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cleaning up code
    \item Making presentation slides
    \item Writing report
\end{itemize}
\end{document}
