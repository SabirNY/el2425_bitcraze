## Investigate
* General dependencies between crazyflie-ros package and lps-ros package?
* What type of controller is actually running when doing lps-ros with dwm_loc_ekf_hover for example.
* It would be better to get the crazyflie-ros controller up and running instead
	* This is through he launch file crazyflie2.launch
* Why is there a bias in the z-direction? 
* Are the batteries bad?
