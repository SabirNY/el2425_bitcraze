# Weekly Meeting W48
The main goal of this week is to make the crazyflie follow a trajectory. We have also a few subtasks that need to be done

* Imran(?) will solder push buttons onto the crazyflies
* Pedram and Robert will set up a logging environment (Log to data files, matlab script to analyse and plot)
* Caro and Joakim will work on overriding the goal publisher and set up scripts to assign new goal points
* Saber and Pedram will create a custom launch file and improve hover script with land service to simplify workflow
* Hui(?) and Imran(?) will look into how we could simulate the crazyflie to test algorithms offline
